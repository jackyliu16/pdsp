我想通过与你分享一首我最喜欢的诗“The Guy in the Glass”，来结束我们对 truth 的探索。我十几岁的时候第一次听到它，它对我产生了很大的影响。我希望你会像我一样珍惜它。顺便说一句，这首诗第一行中的单词 *pelf* 是“财富”的意思。

> When you get what you want in your struggle for pelf,<br />
> And the world makes you King for a day,<br />
> Then go to the mirror and look at yourself,<br />
> And see what that guy has to say.<br />
>
> For it isn't your Father, or Mother, or Wife,<br />
> Who judgement upon you must pass.<br />
> The feller whose verdict counts most in your life<br />
> Is the guy staring back from the glass.<br />
>
> He's the feller to please, never mind all the rest,<br />
> For he's with you clear up to the end,<br />
> And you've passed your most dangerous, difficult test<br />
> If the guy in the glass is your friend.<br />
>
> You may be like jack Horner and "chisel" a plum,<br />
> And think you're a wonderful guy,<br />
> But the man in the glass says you're only a bum<br />
> If you can't look him straight in the eye.<br />
>
> You can fool the whole world down the pathway of years,<br />
> And get pats on the back as you pass,<br />
> But your final reward will be heartaches and tears<br />
> If you've cheated the guy in the glass.<br />
>

我建议你按照字面意思按照诗的第一节的说明去做。去看看镜子前的自己。那个盯着玻璃看的人是你的朋友吗？

如果你想成长为有意识的人，你必须学会接受真相，放弃虚假。truth 促进成长；虚假毁灭它。每当你觉得自己偏离了生活的轨道时，就停下来问问自己：“我与 truth 保持一致了吗？”如果答案是否定的，那就努力让自己的处境更真实、更有意识和更能接受。

现在，让我们把注意力转向我们发现 truth 的主要机制：...原则
